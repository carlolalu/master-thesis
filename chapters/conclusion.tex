Add here the possible work that somebody might develop from this:

- prove that the pide system that you found does have a solution $a$

- prove that such solution has constant mass in a weak sense

- prove that there are waves in the PIDE model which do resemble the ones found by the paper (quote paper that you found which has a good explanation of the waves) if the velocity of the camp becomes very fast wrt the velocity of the amoebas

- expand further the model by changing the potential: a cutoff coulomb potential, or, much better, a short interaction potential, like a discontinous potential that after a certain amount of space cuts to 0. You can operate by mollifying that. Indeed all your theorems and result might want to be adapted for a general situation of such kind

- try different potentials:
	- coulomb potential with cut-off, to erase the singularity (here the problem is with the lipschitz constant)
	- short interaction potential, \ie potential cut to 0 outside a certain range. You might want to mollify that and operated with a mollified version
